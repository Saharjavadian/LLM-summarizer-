# LLM-summarizer-

This project uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze and summarize a **table of documents** (CSV or Excel).  
It automatically generates high-level insights, thematic groupings, and actionable recommendations from structured document metadata.

The goal is to demonstrate how LLMs can be applied to **real-world data analysis workflows**, not just plain text.
